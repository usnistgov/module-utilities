### Changed

- Revert to TypeVar `S` being invariant. This leads to some issues with
  `cached.prop` decorator. However, the use of covariant `TypeVar` was a hack.
  Instead, it is better in these cases to decorate with `@property` on top of
  `@cached.meth`. mypy/pyright deal with `property` in a special way.
- To better work with the above, single parameter methods are caached using only
  the method name, and no parameters.
